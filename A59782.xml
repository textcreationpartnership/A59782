            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>It is to be lamented even to aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, at the madneſs and folly of many perſons profeſſing to be godly, that they do ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extol <hi>the Praying by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> and yet altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the uſe of thoſe <hi>Pſalms and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Eph. 5.19.

                        <p>O how good and profitable a thing it is to ſpeak of the holy Jeſus with affectionate deſires and devotions! but much more effectual are good deeds, than good words.

                        <p>O bleſſed Jeſu, Saviour of the world, ſave me and deliver me from all mine offences: nail them to thy Croſs; bury them in thy Grave; let them never riſe up in judgment againſt me to my condemnation at the laſt great day.</p>

                     <p>To pretend that all theſe Chriſtian duties are implied, and may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied through the fulneſs of Faith in Chriſt, is a falſe and miſtaken notion of the holy and true Chriſtian Faith, which both Commends and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, not the aiery empty notions, but the real performance of all theſe Religious duties.</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Lord, in his heavenly Sermon on the Mount, joyns theſe together, and we may not without danger to our Souls preſume to part them, or vainly conceive that any one without the other will be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God: but being all ſincerely practiſed as our Lord directs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1, 5.16. we ſhall then as he Commands, <hi>lay up for our ſelves treaſure in Heaven, where are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moth nor ruſt.</hi> ver. 20.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. Our fire feeds only upon groſs and corporeal ſubſtances, but <hi>Hell fire</hi> feeds upon ſpirits and damned ſouls; and 'tis therefore as much more fierce and piercing than our fire, as a ſpirit is more quick and active, than a groſs heavy body.</p>
                        <p>Be not deceived (O my Soul) with any fond conceits of vain men, that this fire is only metaphorical, or phantaſtical, or poetical, becauſe 'tis prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who are ſpirits, and not lyable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:36981:151"/>to viſible flames: But the word of God which cannot lye, and many undeniable reaſons by the learned deduced thence, do confirm it to be a real, yea a material fire,

                           </note> but more ſpiritual and refined, and ſo more eating, piercing and tormenting than the fire which burns upon our hearts.</p>

                        <p>And as the fire of concupiſcence doth now more or leſs rage in thy heart, ſo as to follow the ſway there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo ſhall the fire of hell be, more or leſs raging hereafter, if theſe luſts do not dye within thee, before the death of nature ſeize thee.</p>

                        <p>The Pains of Hell in the extent of them do herein differ from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bodily pains: that theſe are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial only in ſome particular parts, joynts and members of the body, whilſt other parts are free from pain: But in Hell the whole man in all the ſenſes internal and external, in all the parts of his body and powers of his ſoul, yea the moſt ſpiritual faculties ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, rage and deſpite, grief and anguiſh, miſery and malediction. The pains of Hell are a concourſe of all kinds of pain, and of all at the ſame time, and of all of them for ever.</p>
                        <p>The Taſte ſhall be puniſhed with bitterneſs, the Appetite with hunger, and the Tongue with thirſt, the Sight with horror, the Hearing with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, the Smell with ſtench, the Heart with anguiſh, the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with fear, the Reaſon with
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:36981:153"/>madneſs, the Judgment with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in the very Bowels fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable.</p>
                        <p>And this is moſt juſt, that as the wicked have employed all the powers and parts both of Soul and Body, as weapons of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin; ſo ſhould their puniſhment be in all their ſenſes, members, faculties — that as each hath tranſgreſt by ſinful pleaſure, and inordinate delight, ſo each ſhould have its peculiar afflicting torment.</p>
                        <p>'Tis undoubtedly true, that all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons condemned to the flames of the nether hell are not equally tormented therein: for though the fire of hell be one and the ſame, yet it torments not all after the ſame manner, nor in the ſame degree of torture: but every man ſhall therein more or leſs feel the ſmart of its fury, as by the nature, quality and frequency of his ſin, he hath leſs or more deſerved the ſame:
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.25</note> for <hi>ſhall not the Judge of all the world do right?</hi>

                        <p>The more high, peremptory and preſumptuous, as alſo the leſs obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and impenitent ſinner ſhall both ſuffer under the torment of the ſame

                        <p>There be many who now think this or that to be ſevere commands, <hi>Love your enemies— Deny thy ſelf, Faſt, and Watch and Pray— Take up thy Croſs—</hi> but ſurely 'twill be much more hard and bitter to hear,

                     <p>THere is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Soul and Body in the dignity of their nature: the Soul is of a heavenly deſcent and original; but the body is of earthly mould and making: the Soul is framed by the hands of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after his own Image; but the Body is begotten of earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, after the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh: the Soul is of the ſame nature with the Angels of Heaven; but
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:36981:184"/>the Body is of kind and conſtitution with the beaſts of the earth: the Soul being the infuſion of Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the beauties and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the moſt high and holy God; but the Body being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of carnal copulation, aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates only the fading ſhadows of beauty in irrational beings: Laſtly, whatever beauty, ſtrength, motion or Life it ſelf the Body enjoys, is by the vertue, vigor, and actuation of the Soul which manifeſts its immortality, and ſeparate ſubſiſtence from the dying Body.</p>
                     <p>Very pertinent then is that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to fond ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs man: <hi>Laboras ut non moriatur homo meriturus: &amp; non laboras nè peccet in aeternum victurus?</hi> Why art thou ſo ſolicitous to preſerve the body from death, which muſt dye, and doſt not endeavour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preſerve from ſin thy Soul which will live for ever?</p>
                     <p>If but a finger of the Body ach, 'tis bemoaned and lapt, and every petty ſore is ſalv'd, and carefully kept from the leaſt touch, that may
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:36981:185"/>annoy it: and to cure the diſeaſes of the Body no coſt or pains is ſpar'd, the moſt bitter drugs are ſwallowed; lancing, burning, faſting, any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or torture is willingly endur'd: but the ſores of ſin are ſuffered to feſter, and the diſeaſes of the Soul are ſlighted, without any regard had to the devout uſe of thoſe holy means, which the great Phyſician of Souls hath preſcribed for their recovery.</p>
                     <p>O remember, and wiſely conſider, that by how much thy Soul tranſcends thy Body in purity of nature, and dignity of condition, by ſo much thy ſpiritual diſeaſes are more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, and deſtructive, than any bodily diſtempers can be.</p>
                     <p>The ilneſs of the Body tends only to the diſanimation of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fleſh: but the maladies of the Soul render her both loathſome in the eyes of God, and all good men, and alſo obnoxious to the Second death, the unſupportable torments of the nether hell.</p>

                        <hi>I am a ſojourner upon earth as all my fathers were,</hi> O pierce my ſoul with the dart of divine love, to bewail the deadneſs of my affections towards thee, to lament that I am ſo much a ſtranger to my native home of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that my heart is not ſurely fixed there where true joys are to be found, but grovels in the duſt of worldly vanities; to grieve that I walk in the midſt of manifold temptations, and my ghoſtly enemies do dayly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt me, and dayly caſt in my teeth my dayly backſlidings from the love, and ſervice of my God: <hi>But be thou merciful unto me, O Lord:
<note place="margin">Pſ. 41.10.</note> Raiſe thou me up again, and I ſhall reward them,</hi> by my future conqueſts over all their temptations.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WHoſoever deſires that the Lord would vouchſafe to come unto him, muſt himſelf firſt prepare his heart to come unto God: And this not by Faith alone, but by divine love, and obedience to his moſt holy Laws: <hi>If any man love me he will keep my Sayings,
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.23.</note> and my father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our abode with him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How, and when the Lord comes, and abides with us, muſt be known by the influences and operations of his preſence, as the tree by its fruits, or the cauſe by its effects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.7.</note> and ſuch are the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Souls in whom he abides,
<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.5.</note> 
                        <hi>they are all children of the light, and of the day, not of night, and of darkneſs:</hi> Their underſtandings are enlightned to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:36981:188"/>know God, both in himſelf, and in the ways of his ſervice, and of their own Salvation: and this light of their Faith ſhines before men, in all the good works of Soberneſs, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Godlineſs to the glory of God the father of lights.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>God is a conſuming fire:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 12.29.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Souls poſſeſſed by him are purged as with fire from all the ſordid luſts of the fleſh, and of the world, their affections are purified, the ruſt of ſloth and negligence in the ways of life is ſcowred off, their hearts as with fire are inflamed with the ſacred ardors of divine Love, of a holy and diſcreet Zeal, of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Devotion in their Prayers unto God, and praiſes of him, and with earneſt defires of a nearer, and a more immediate Communion with his divine Majeſty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>God is the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and accordingly where he dwells,
<note place="margin">Jer. 2.13.</note> he does allay the heat of carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, ſubdue the inordinate love of riches, quench the fire of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:36981:189"/>ſtrife and contention, of blind Zeal and Faction, and of every exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant luſt: being in himſelf a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all the vaſt deſires of the immortal Soul.</p>
                     <p>As water he ſatisfieth the deſires of all who hunger, and thirſt after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and by the influence of his divine grace, makes the barren ground of the heart to be fruitful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every good word and work.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God is all purity and holineſs, goodneſs and mercy, juſtice and truth; and in a word, the ſummary of all perfection and felicity: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe happy Souls where he dwells, are holy as he is holy, pure as he is pure, merciful as he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, juſt and good, gracious and long-ſuffering; and in a word, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as our heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                     <p>'Tis ſuch divinely enſpirited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and only ſuch can ſay with the heavenly inſpired Pſalmiſt: <hi>I will love thee, O Lord, my ſtrength; the Lord is my ſtony rock, and my defence, my Saviour, my God, and my might,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:36981:189"/>in whom I will truſt, my buckler and the horn of my ſalvation, and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> Pſal. 18.1. <hi>and</hi> Pſal. 27.1. <hi>The Lord is my light, and my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom then ſhall I fear? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom then ſhall I be afraid? and</hi> Pſal. 28.8. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my ſhield, my heart hath truſted in him and I am helped: therefore my heart danceth for joy, and in my ſong will I praiſe him— The Lord is my ſtrength, and he is the wholſom defence of his anointed— O ſave thy people, and give thy bleſſing to thine inheritance, feed them, and ſet them up for ever.</hi>
